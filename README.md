# Balloon Pop ðŸŽˆ

This is a small game I made as part of the Code in Place 2025 course by Stanford.  
It's a simple idea â€” you have to protect a balloon from falling shapes by bouncing them away using a dot that you move.

## What it does

- Falling shapes try to hit the balloon.
- You control a dot and push them away to keep the balloon safe.
- It keeps score based on how long the balloon survives.
- All logic is coded manually â€” no game engine or libraries used.

## Why I built it

Honestly, I just wanted to make something interactive and fun that also pushed my understanding of real-time interaction and logic.  
Had no idea making a game like this from scratch (especially bouncing mechanics) would be this tricky, but fun.

## Files

- `main.py` â€“ runs the game
- `ui.py` â€“ handles drawing and the canvas
- `game_logic.py` â€“ contains the actual logic (collision, direction, etc)
- `constants.py` â€“ for variables like speed, size
- `shapes.py` â€“ handles the balloons and falling blocks

## Requirements

Youâ€™ll need Python and the `graphics.py` file from Stanfordâ€™s Code in Place course to run it.

This was my final project for the course and honestly one of the things Iâ€™m most proud of this year.
